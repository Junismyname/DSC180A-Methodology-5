1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
   How machine learning can detect a small particle that are lighter than atom.
3. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
   I will be tasked with a model to predict one of the character of the particle.
   I would like to look more towards classification between multi-sited event
   and single-sited events. 
5. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
   I am currently building simple classification model. I would like to try different models in the future.
7. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
   I want to try applying CNN and other state-of-art machine learning techniques for time series data.
